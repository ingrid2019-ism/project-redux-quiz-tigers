# Redux quiz group project

This was a group project I did while attending Technigo 24 week frontend program. During two days our team's task was to build a quiz game using Redux. It's a multiple choice quiz, and we decided to make a Harry Potter quiz.

## The problem

The project had a predefined Redux store and a reducer with a few actions we could use to control our quiz. But this was our very first encounter with Redux so it was hard for us to wrap our head around the concept and how to get it to work. At first we did mob programming all of us together, but the second day we split up in smaller groups focusing on different problems.
